-- Monte-carlo simulations is used for hypothesis testing

    Sevaral regression statistics are computed and compared on increasingly collinear datasets. (OLS, Ridge, Lasso). 

    Comparisons in bias, var, RMSE and RE.

    Code is implemented in R.


-- Permutation tests is used for hypothesis testing
